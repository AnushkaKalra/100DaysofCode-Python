# Describe the Problem - Write your answers as comments:
# 1. What is the for loop doing? - Checking values from 1-20 and then printing "You got it" if 20 is encountered
# 2. When is the function meant to print "You got it"? - When value of i is 20
# 3. What are your assumptions about the value of i? - 20, anywhere from 1 to 19, 21
